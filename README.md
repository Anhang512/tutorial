## <a name="Docker"></a>Build and install docker image

Follow the instrucions [here](https://github.com/Inception-framework/docker).

## < a name="Start"></a>Quick start

Once inside a shell in docker, we can clone this repo and compile & run a simple example.

Cloning:
```
cd /home/inception
git clone https://github.com/Inception-framework/tutorial.git
```

Compiling a program with 1 Fibonacci function in C and one in assembly (using Inception-translator):
```
cd tutorial
make
```

Running with Inception-compiler:
```
klee main_merged.bc
````

The end of the output should be:
```
fibonacci1(10) = 55
fibonacci_golden(10) = 55
ok
```

## <a name="Step"></a>Step by step

### The program

The main program is main.c, written in C and inline assembly. The main function calls a Fibonacci function written in C and one written in assembly, and then it compares the results with an assertion.
The conditional compilation variable KLEE is used to enclose those parts of the code that should run only in Klee, but not on the target device (e.g., printf and assert that are used for debug). 

### Compilation to binary

We need the elf of the program, that we will then merge with the LLVM coming from clang. Therefore, we want to compile the program with gcc (arm toolchain). We also need a linker script (link.ld) and a startup file (startup.s). They are particularly important for setting some sections: .interrupt_vector (or .isr_vector), .stack, .main_stack, .heap. The last two are necessary only in case of multithreading and dynamic allocation, respectively. They are recognized and used by Inception-analyzer to create a correct memory layout.

```
arm-none-eabi-gcc -march=armv7-m -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m3 -Wa,-mimplicit-it=thumb -g -c main.c -o main.o
arm-none-eabi-as -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=softfp -c startup.s -o startup.o
arm-none-eabi-ld main.o startup.o -T link.ld -o main.elf
```
### Compilation to LLVM

The C part of the program can be compiled to LLVM-IR using CLang.

```
clang --target=thumbv7m-elf -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=softfp -emit-llvm -IAnalyzer/include -S -g -DKLEE  -c main.c -o main.ll
llvm-as main.ll -o main.bc
```

The .ll file is LLVM in human readable format. Have a look at it, you can clearly see that the inline assembly has not been translated, for example:

```
call void asm sideeffect "push\09{r4, r7, lr}", ""() #5, !dbg !19, !srcloc !20
```

If you try to run the main.bc, klee will return an error:

```
klee main.bc
```

```
KLEE: ERROR: /home/inception/tutorial/main.c line:9, klee_last/assembly.ll line: 79, inline assembly is unsupported
```

### Lift and merge with Inception-translator

We can now feed main.bc and main.elf to Inception-translator (inception-cl), in order to obtain a unified representation.

```
inception-cl main.elf main.bc
```

The output will look like the following. You can clearly see that the tool detects the function containing assembly and starts processing it. Warnings are mainly for debug reasons. The important ones are those related to the missing sections. In this case we do not need to worry as we do not have dynamic allocation, nor multithreading (no need for .heap and .main_stack), and we have .stack and .interrupt_vector (alternative to .isr_vector). You can also observe that the tool generates many helper functions, for example inception_icp handles indirect calls, and *_sp handle the dual stack mode.

```

The output of the program is main.elf.ll. This time, it does not contain non-translated assembly anymore. For example, the line shown before has now become pure LLVM:

```
  %R4_1 = load i32* @R4, !dbg !19
  %R7_1 = load i32* @R7, !dbg !19
  %LR1 = load i32* @LR, !dbg !19
  %SP1 = load i32* @SP, !dbg !19
  %SP2 = sub i32 %SP1, 4, !dbg !19
  %SP3 = inttoptr i32 %SP2 to i32*, !dbg !19
  store i32 %LR1, i32* %SP3, !dbg !19
  %SP4 = sub i32 %SP2, 4, !dbg !19
  %SP5 = inttoptr i32 %SP4 to i32*, !dbg !19
  store i32 %R7_1, i32* %SP5, !dbg !19
  %SP6 = sub i32 %SP4, 4, !dbg !19
  %SP7 = inttoptr i32 %SP6 to i32*, !dbg !19
  store i32 %R4_1, i32* %SP7, !dbg !19
  store i32 %SP6, i32* @SP, !dbg !19
```

Therefore, wÃ¬e can now assemble it and run it, as shown in the next section.

```
llvm-as main.elf.ll -o main_merged.bc
```

Another output of the program is the disassembled fucntion fibonacci_asm.dis. The llvm code in main.elf.ll maps the llvm instruction that implement the inline assembly to the lines in this .dis file. A known limitation is the incorrect visualization of functions with multiple returns, that are however supported and working (you can see the corresponding warning in the log).

### Running with Inception-analyzer

```
klee main_merged.bc
```

The output will be the following.

```

You can observe a very detaied log of the memory allocations.
The layout is the same as on the real device, a part from some strings and the processor registers, which are allocated at some separate host address. Besides the variables, you can can see the allocation of the stack section thanks to .stack, and that of the interrupt vector thanks to .interrupt_vector. You can see the memory mapped registers mapped at predefined registers and redirected to the real target. You can also see that klee calls the host printf, and that its output is correct as expected.
Finllay, you can see some stats.

Inception-analyzer runs only if is configured with the config.json file.
This file provides a path to the elf binary, the configuration of redirection, and the mapping of all the mapped registers.
In this example redirection is disabled. We also provide a static interrupt vector mapping, but we do not use it (by default we use the dynamic one in the .interrupt_vector section).

## <a name="Samples"></a>Some more interesting samples

Now that we have an idea about how Inception can be used, we can show some more complex examples taken from [here](https://github.com/Inception-framework/usenix-samples).

### Synthetic tests

We have written a large number of test cases to validate the correct functionality of Inception. Many of them where written and improved over time to catch as many bugs as possible. Some are inspired or taken from real-world cases (e.g., to stress the context switch mechanism used by FreeRTOS). You can find them in ```samples/synthetic_tests```. We will here show a few interesting ones.

#### Interactions

The tests ```interactions``` and  ```interactions2``` aim at testing support for function calls and returns (type and number of parameters, direct/indirect, C to binary and binary to C, etc.). Have a look at the code in ```samples/synthetic_tests/Examples/interactions/main.c``` and ```samples/synthetic_tests/Examples/interactions2/main.c```
Then compile and run them with:
```
./build.sh interactions lpc18xx
```
```
./build.sh interactions2 lpc18xx
```
The build script calls a makefile, sets the configuration script for the board specified as second parameter, and it runs the code in klee.
You can follow the log of Inception-translator and of the memory allocation in Inception-analyzer to follow the steps. Also have a look at the resulting mixed-IR code in ```Examples/interactions/klee-last/assembly.ll``` and ```Examples/interactions2/klee-last/assembly.ll```

#### Multithread

We wrote a few tests for multithreading. Though the code is much simpler than that of an Operating System, it stresses all the main components of Inception-translator and Inception-verifier that handle multithreading. We used them to test our solutions our development. Once stable, Inception was able to run the real multithreading code of FreeRTOS, shown in other samples of this repository.

Remember to ***comment the ---disable-interrupt option in the Makefile***, then type:
```
./build.sh multithread lpc18xx
```

### Complex functions

We have tested a complex arithmetic function of MbedTLS:

```
./build.sh mpi_mul_hlp lpc18xx
```

### Some Klee tests

Here is an example of error detection both in C and assembly.

```
./build.sh 2008-03-04-free-of-global lpc18xx 
```

```
./build.sh 2008-03-04-free-of-global-asm lpc18xx 
```
